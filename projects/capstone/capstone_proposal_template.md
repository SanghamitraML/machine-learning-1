### Domain Background


Credit risk is the possibility of a loss resulting from a borrower's failure to repay a loan or meet contractual obligations. Traditionally, it refers to the risk that a lender may not receive the owed principal and interest. Although it's impossible to know exactly who will default on obligations, properly assessing and managing credit risk can lessen the severity of a loss. Interest payments from the borrower or issuer of a debt obligation are a lender's or investor's reward for assuming credit risk. In recent times, the US subprime crisis is an example of huge financial crisis. In essence the core reson for the financial crisis was a broader trend of lowered lending standards and higher-risk mortgage products. Insufficient understand of credit risk can become a problem of huge proportions. Ont he other hand too much tightening of lending will exclude people from lower income groups from organized banking. The solution is to find a balanced solution which will enable more and more people to access credit while providing a complete understanding of the risk involved.

Home credit focusses on providing small loans to people with little or no credit history.

Data Source

This is a featured competition is Kaggle and I will be using the data set from Kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk/overview

### Problem Statement

In this capstone project, I will build a model that will predict the probability of an applicant to repay their loan. 
The applicant population being considered for this project are people with little or no credit history. Due to this the risk of lending to this segment is traditionally considered very high. They often get exclused from formal banking. However with the advances in Data analysis and machine learning, we have the opportunity to go beyond traditional risk analysis and use data other than credit history to understand better the ability of an applicant to repay the loan.
A good ML model with help provide credit to this underserved segment as well as lower the crdit risk for the lending organization in this case Home Credit.
Considering the consequences of nonrepayment of loans, it is important for the model to minimize false positives.


### Datasets and Inputs
This dataset has been provided by Home Credit for Kaggle.

There are 7 different sources of data:

1. application_train/application_test: The main training data with information about each loan application at Home Credit. Every loan has its own row and is identified by the feature SK_ID_CURR. The training application data comes with the TARGET indicating 0: the loan was repaid or 1: the loan was not repaid. Here we will use only the Training data.
2. bureau: In this dataset it consists of data concerning clientâ€™s previous credits from other financial institutions. Each previous credit has its own row in bureau, but one loan in the application data can have multiple previous credits.
3. bureau_balance: It consists of monthly data about the previous credits in bureau. Each row is one month of a previous credit, and a single previous credit can have multiple rows, one for each month of the credit length.
4. previous_application:The data of previous applications for loans at Home Credit of clients who have loans in the application data. Each current loan in the application data can have multiple previous loans. Each previous application has one row and is identified by the feature SK_ID_PREV.
5. POS_CASH_BALANCE: It consists of monthly data about previous point of sale or cash loans clients have had with Home Credit. Each row is one month of a previous point of sale or cash loan, and a single previous loan can have many rows.
6. credit_card_balance:The monthly data about previous credit cards clients have had with Home Credit. Each row is one month of a credit card balance, and a single credit card can have many rows.
7. installments_payment:The data of payment history for previous loans at Home Credit. There is one row for every made payment and one row for every missed payment.

The dataset contains broadly the application data and loan payback related information.

### Solution Statement

This is a classification problem. The aim is to classify an applicant as defaulter or non-defaulter.I will divide my solution into the following parts:
1. Data Analysis
I will begin by analysing the data and understanding the shape of the underlying data, identify missing data, sparse dimensions etc.
2. Feature engineering and dimentionality reduction - Feature engineering will be a very important part of this solution. This is also evident from an understanding of the solutions presented
3. Model development - The last step will be choosing the best fit model
4. Model evaluation and accuracy

### Benchmark Model
I am proposing to use the scores of the contestants of the Kaggle competition as the benchmark result. There is no openly available benchmark model to compare against.

### Evaluation Metrics
On preliminany analysis,  the data available appears to be an Imbalanced Dataset, hence we cannot simply use Accuracy as a metric for evaluating the performance of the model. There are some metrics that work well with imbalanced datasets, of which we will use the below-mentioned metrics - 

1. ROC-AUC Score: This metric is insensitive to class imbalance. It works by ranking the probabilities of prediction of the positive class label and calculating the Area under the ROC Curve which is plotted between True Positive Rates and False Positive Rates for each threshold value.
2. Recall Score: It is the ratio of the True Positives predicted by the model and the total number of Actual Positives. It is also known as True Positive Rate.
3. Precision Score: It is the ratio of True Positives and the Total Positives predicted by the model.
4. Confusion Matrix: The confusion matrix helps us to visualize the mistakes made by the model on each of the classes, be it positive or negative. Hence, it tells us about misclassifications for both classes.

### Project Design

The first step in project design is Data Preparation.

Data Analysis and Cleaning - I will ascertain the quality of the 7 data sets provided. Various techniques can be applied to improve data quality like filling up missing values or in extreme cases dropping observations with bad data altogether.

Feature Engineering - The next step is Feature Engineering, where I will come up with new ways and features to transform our data. There were around 220 raw features in our dataset. The goal here is to find out if we can reduce dimentionality and determine the features which significantly impact the target variable.

Machine Learning Model 

I would like to evaluate the following models for this problem:

1. Randon Forest
2. XGBoost Classifier
3. Light GBM
4. Logistic Regression

Basis the performance the best model will be selected.

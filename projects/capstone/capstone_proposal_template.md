### Proposal

### Domain Background

In this section, provide brief details on the background information of the domain from which the project is proposed. Historical information relevant to the project should be included. It should be clear how or why a problem in the domain can or should be solved. Related academic research should be appropriately cited in this section, including why that research is relevant. Additionally, a discussion of your personal motivation for investigating a particular problem in the domain is encouraged but not required.

Credit risk is the possibility of a loss resulting from a borrower's failure to repay a loan or meet contractual obligations. Traditionally, it refers to the risk that a lender may not receive the owed principal and interest. Although it's impossible to know exactly who will default on obligations, properly assessing and managing credit risk can lessen the severity of a loss. Interest payments from the borrower or issuer of a debt obligation are a lender's or investor's reward for assuming credit risk. In recent times, the US subprime crisis is an example of huge financial crisis. In essence the core reson for the financial crisis was a broader trend of lowered lending standards and higher-risk mortgage products. Insufficient understand of credit risk can become a problem of huge proportions. Ont he other hand too much tightening of lending will exclude people from lower income groups from organized banking. The solution is to find a balanced solution which will enable more and more people to access credit while providing a complete understanding of the risk involved.

Home credit focusses on providing small loans to people with little or no credit history.

Data Source

This is a featured competition is Kaggle and I will be using the data set from Kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk/overview

### Problem Statement

In this capstone project, I will build a model that will predict the probability of an applicant to repay their loan. 
The applicant population being considered for this project are people with little or no credit history. Due to this the risk of lending to this segment is traditionally considered very high. They often get exclused from formal banking. However with the advances in Data analysis and machine learning, we have the opportunity to go beyond traditional risk analysis and use data other than credit history to understand better the ability of an applicant to repay the loan.
A good ML model with help provide credit to this underserved segment as well as lower the crdit risk for the lending organization in this case Home Credit.
Considering the consequences of nonrepayment of loans, it is important for the model to minimize false positives.


### Datasets and Inputs
_(approx. 2-3 paragraphs)_

In this section, the dataset(s) and/or input(s) being considered for the project should be thoroughly described, such as how they relate to the problem and why they should be used. Information such as how the dataset or input is (was) obtained, and the characteristics of the dataset or input, should be included with relevant references and citations as necessary It should be clear how the dataset(s) or input(s) will be used in the project and whether their use is appropriate given the context of the problem.

### Solution Statement
_(approx. 1 paragraph)_

In this section, clearly describe a solution to the problem. The solution should be applicable to the project domain and appropriate for the dataset(s) or input(s) given. Additionally, describe the solution thoroughly such that it is clear that the solution is quantifiable (the solution can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms) , measurable (the solution can be measured by some metric and clearly observed), and replicable (the solution can be reproduced and occurs more than once).

### Benchmark Model
_(approximately 1-2 paragraphs)_

In this section, provide the details for a benchmark model or result that relates to the domain, problem statement, and intended solution. Ideally, the benchmark model or result contextualizes existing methods or known information in the domain and problem given, which could then be objectively compared to the solution. Describe how the benchmark model or result is measurable (can be measured by some metric and clearly observed) with thorough detail.

### Evaluation Metrics
_(approx. 1-2 paragraphs)_

In this section, propose at least one evaluation metric that can be used to quantify the performance of both the benchmark model and the solution model. The evaluation metric(s) you propose should be appropriate given the context of the data, the problem statement, and the intended solution. Describe how the evaluation metric(s) are derived and provide an example of their mathematical representations (if applicable). Complex evaluation metrics should be clearly defined and quantifiable (can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms).

### Project Design
_(approx. 1 page)_

In this final section, summarize a theoretical workflow for approaching a solution given the problem. Provide thorough discussion for what strategies you may consider employing, what analysis of the data might be required before being used, or which algorithms will be considered for your implementation. The workflow and discussion that you provide should align with the qualities of the previous sections. Additionally, you are encouraged to include small visualizations, pseudocode, or diagrams to aid in describing the project design, but it is not required. The discussion should clearly outline your intended workflow of the capstone project.
